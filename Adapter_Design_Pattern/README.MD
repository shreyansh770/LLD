# Adapter Design Pattern

1) It is a bridge b/w an "Existing Interface" and "Expected Interface"

Ex : 
-   Let say we have socket (*Existing Interface*) and a charger (*Expected Interface*)
-   socket has square pockets and charger has round pins
-   so to plug in the charger we will use an **Adapter**


Adapter **has a** *existing interface* obj
